# how to pull data of all branches from remote ?

To get data of all branches from a remote repository, you can use the following steps:

- First, navigate to your local repository using the command line or terminal.

- Run the following command to see all the branches available on the remote repository:

```js
git branch -r
This command will list all the remote branches available on the remote repository.
```

- To fetch all the branches and their data from the remote repository, run the following command:

```js
git fetch --all
This command will fetch all the branches from the remote repository and update the local repository.
```

- To check all the branches and their data, run the following command:

```js
git branch -a
This command will list all the local and remote branches available in your local repository.
```

- Once you have fetched all the branches and their data, you can switch to any branch using the git checkout command followed by the branch name. For example, to switch to a branch named "new-feature", you can run the following command:

```js
git checkout new-feature
```

This will switch your local repository to the "new-feature" branch and you can work on it or view its data.
